                    <p> Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (Persian: محمد بن موسی خوارزمی, romanized: Moḥammad
                        ben Musā Khwārazmi; c. 780 – c. 850), was a Persian polymath from
                        Khwarazm, who produced vastly influential works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography.
                        Around 820 CE, he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom
                        in
                        Baghdad.</p>
                    <p> Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (The Compendious Book on Calculation by
                        Completion
                        and
                        Balancing, c. 813–833 CE[13]: 171 ) presented the first systematic solution of linear and
                        quadratic
                        equations. <span span class="highlights">Because he
                        was
                        the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline </span> and introduced the methods
                        of
                        "reduction"
                        and
                        "balancing" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is,
                        the
                        cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation), <span class="highlights">he has
                            been described as the
                            fatheror founder of algebra. The term algebra itself comes from the title of his book
                            (the word al-jabr meaning "completion" or "rejoining").</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> <span span class="highlights">His name gave rise to the terms algorism and
                            algorithm.</span> In the 12th century, Latin translations of his textbook on arithmetic
                        (Algorithmo de Numero
                        Indorum) which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number
                        system to the
                        Western
                        world.</p>
